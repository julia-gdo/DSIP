6.3: it does not open nor run.Â When put in the hex reader, the file becomes more compressed, there is no more header or anything telling the computer how to run. It also did change the bytes within the file as well. 
It tells me that the file is locked and if I want to make changes to it I must unlock it. This is because it's "read only" therefore I don't have permission to change the content within the file.
